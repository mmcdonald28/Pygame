# Pygame
My pygame project / game 
This was a CS1 game development pygame project. I made a skeet shooter game in which you shoot the pigeons that fly across the screen.
I wanted to make the game hard, so then current verison has hitting pigeon give you a point, while missing penalizes a point.
The penalty / difficulty of the can be easily adjusted in the pyhton code to make it easier or make it not penalize.
